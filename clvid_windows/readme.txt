There are several kinds of files:
-Files with .m extension: they are Matlab files which form the top level of the implementation.
-Files with .c and .cpp extensions: they are the C/C++ MEX low level implementation. They are as platform independent as possible, so they are not optimized.
-Files with .mexw64 extension: they are precompiled versions of the MEX files for use in Matlab under 64 bit Windows.
-Files with .dll extension: additional libraries for Windows.

Any suggestions and bug reports will be welcome.

Note: You might want to start by running the demo_cl_vid.m script.
